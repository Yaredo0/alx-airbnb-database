# SQL Join Queries — ALX Airbnb Database

This script demonstrates the use of SQL joins to extract meaningful relationships between users, bookings, properties, and reviews.

## 📁 Files

- `joins_queries.sql`: Contains three SQL queries using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.
- `README.md`: Describes the purpose and usage of the queries.

## 🧠 Query Summary

1. **INNER JOIN**: Retrieves all bookings and the users who made them.
2. **LEFT JOIN**: Retrieves all properties and their reviews, including properties without reviews.
3. **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Retrieves all users and all bookings, even if they are not linked.

Run the queries in your SQL environment connected to the Airbnb database schema. Make sure the following tables exist:
- `users`
- `bookings`
- `properties`
- `reviews`
